>name indicate much of codes and logic resides in html template
some of the key points refers related to template driven form 
--------------------------------------------------------------
>tdf approch easy to use and similar to angular 1 form 
>in this approch we heavily relay in two way data binding
>we have to keep track input field value and react to change tract input field
value
>angular takes care of that with ngModel directive
>as result though we have bulky html code and minimal component code 
>in tdf approch angular provide ngform directive along with ng model directive
automatically track form and formelement state and velidity
>draw backs of tdf approch when come in unit testing
>form velidation logic cannot be unit tested
>only way of testing is end to end test in browser
>secode draw back is handlling the complex forms
>as we add more and more validation on field and if we add complex cross field validation
>readibility of form is decreases upto great extent
>quetion is when we should go to tdf approch
>if we have to create simple form with unit testing handlled by browser
>go with tdf approch
>more complex forms with unit testing is ablulutly necessary go with reactive forms.
>now breif about tdf approch lets start how we procedding on tdf approch
>we going to startup by going to generate new cliproject
>we add html represnt html we will work on it
>after that we will have to loook on data binding
>that is followed by tracking from state and validity
>providing visual feedback and displaying error messages
>finally we will bindup tdf structure creating express server
>posting data from our angular application to express server
>next video we need to create angular project using angular cli

>creating new project generating new project we have to use angualr cli
>to more specific angular cli version 10 or highter
>in the command prompt iam going to run command ng -v
>this gives version of cli installed in my machine
>you can sea that is verison 10.0.1
>you gyes might not be cli installed all in command prompt put command
>npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
>this will install latest verion of angular cli on your machine
>some of you might have installed angular cli but not latest verion you need tu update
>how to update latest verion
>go to github repo for angular cli 
>if you  scroll down you can find particular paragraph
>yoiu can find pragraph
angular devking
develepment tools and libraries specaialized for angular
this is the home of hte devikigt and the angular cli coded you can find the angular cli
specific reamdme here
klick on here and scroll down you should come table of contents where you get
>updating angular cli
>over there mentioned the updating global package exactly what you need
>to update cli in your machine run this three comand insequence
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache verify
#fi npm version is less thene ues "npm cache clean"
npm install -g @angular /clie@latest
>ones you finish all then you write on command on clien ng--version
>it should display version latest
>now we have the latest cli lets generte the angualr project
>open visual studio code to open the integreted terminal (ctrl+`) contorl plus backtick
>or view intergrated terminal
>and run command ng new projectname
example
ng new tdf
>hit enter it should create project for your ones the command completd
>ones compled navigate inside project forlder and cd tdf
>and run command ng server -o
>we should have our application have up and running
>final step to add bootstrap styling in out project
>bootstrap is css framework  thats gives us a variety of classes that can apply to 
>make html look better
>to add bootstrap css go to getbootstrap.com and navigate to getting started tab
>scroll down to bootstrap cdn and jsut copy the bootstrap cdn path
>copy the cdn path and put the reference the end of the tag
>now test bootstap classes are work or not
>now open app.component.html and wipe out html pre filled
>iam going to add button tag we add class button.btn.primary
<button class="btn btn-primary">submit</button>
>bootstrap works it should display blue color button
>go back to tdf and you can sea blue color submit button

=======================
> lets create a form in app.component.html
<div class="container-fluid">
<h1>Bootcamp enrollment formm</h1>
<form action=">
//first form contorl is user to enter the name
//here "form-group" and "form-control"are bootstrap classes
//we have label name and corresponding input 
<div class="form-group">
<label>name</label>
<input type="text" class="form-control">
</div>
//next form control entering the email id
//again we have form-group and form-control bootstrap classes and label email
//and input type boxe
//similarly we have form control to entring phone number
<div class="form-group">
<label>phone</label>
<input type="tel" class="form-control">
</div>
//next control is select tag to user choose topic to there is interested on it
//first we have to create array of  topics in app.component.ts
//iam going to create new topics in aap.component.ts is going to be an array
inside app.component.ts
=============================
import{Component} from "@angular/core"
@Component({
selector:"app-root",
templateUrl:"./app.component.html",
styleUrls:['./app.component.css']
});
export class AppComponent{
topics=['Angular','React','Vue'];
}
next bind this to select drop down to html
this is slight different ins
===============================================
>select select tag
>we usd to *ngFor structural directive to itrate list of topics 
>so select dropdown will populate value of array is angular react and view
><div class="form-group">
<select class="custom-select">
<option selected>iam intrested in</option>
<option *ngFor="let topic of topics">{{topic}}</option>
</select>
</div>
>ones user select topics for select then user select the time slot
>for time preference we used to redio button group
we have labele and two possible values
>class form-check is class provide by bootstrap and label uwe use label 
>and we have radio and both are have the same name
>here value how ever is morning and evening
>the value label morning 9 am to 12 pm
>the value label evening 5pm to 8pm
>that is our time preference radio button
<div class="mb-3">
<label>time preference</label>
<div class="form-check">
<input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="timePreference" value="morning">
<label class="form-check-label>mroning(9am-12pm)</label>
</div>
<div classs="form-check">
<input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="timePreference" value="evening">
<input class="form-check-label">evening(5pm-8pm)<label>
</div>
>last control is a check box user to check promotional offers
>again we have to div class for class form-check
>then input is form-check-input
>this time the type going to be check box and name tobe send me promotional offers
>that is the check box to subscribing the promotional offers
<div class="form-check mb-3">
<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox">
<label class="form-check-label">
send me promotional offers
</label>
</div>
>finally we have to put and submit button to submit the form
<button classs="btn btn-primary" type="submit">sumit form</button>
</form>
</div>
>save it and sea the form in the browser

===============================
>in this video let sea how the data binding happning with the form field
>so far we are creating basic html form nothing related to angular
>open app.module.ts
>imports import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';
>and add FormsModule in imports array
so app.module.ts

>if we goto app.component.html we still have basic html form
>but behind the scenes angualr magic already happning
>any time we use form tag angular attaches ngForm derictive to form tag which gives us 
valuable information of particular form.
>it tells what is the value of different form control are or weather the value are 
valid or invalid and how we hold reference of ngForm derictive
>using a template reference variable inside form tag 
<form #userForm="ngForm">
>inside form tag we have to write #userForm to assign ngForm, ngForm directive exports
it self string ngForm and by assigning to reference variable we have reference a 
derictive it self.
>now just maintain derictive give access value of form control
>it does so usig value property
>in the html i have to use interpolation to get value of form control
>{{userForm.value|json}}
>double curly brasses inside passes userForm.value|json  
>if i save this i look in browser we have to sea an empty object
>if i will start name some thing still it shows empty object { timePreference}
>you might be wandring why it happning
>if you ask angular why its happning like this
>it going to tell you hai iam not going to track every single form control in your html
>let me know which form control have to be track that only i will track and how to be know
angular control to be track
>by using ngModel directive so each of form-control we have to place ngModel directive.
><input type="text" class="form-control" ngModel>
><input type="email" class="form-control" ngModel>
><input type="tel" clas="form-control" ngModel>
><select ngModel>
>inside radio buttons select tag and check box we have to write ngModel
>finally for check box also we have to place ngModel
>let save this if we start typing in any input box we cannot sea expected result
>open developer tool and going to console we will sea there is an error
>the error will be if ngModel used withing ia form tag aither the name attribute must me set or the form
control must be define standalone
>we can sea here timePreference works because we used name="timePreference" 
>but rest of form field we dont have a name attribut
>so along with ngModel attribute a name attribute must be necessary
>that is the name attribute for each of form-control  
>we have to write
<input type="text" class="form-control" name="userName" ngModel>
<input type="email" class="form-control" name="email" ngModel>
<input type="tel" class="form-control" name="phone" ngModel>
<select class="custom-select" name="topic" ngModel>
<input class="form-check-input" ngModel type="radio" name="timePreference">
<input class="form-check-input" ngModel name="subscribe" type="checkbox">
>right away go to browser and check how to be difference an object to be displayed
>{"username":"","email":"","phone":"","topics":"","timePreference":"","suscribe":""}
>all the form control are present as property of this particular object
>let start filling in the form and sea what happend
>lets fill the form control names and sea what happend
>{"name":"srlnp","email":"srlnnodejs@gmail.com","phone":9861152315,"timePreferecnce":22.00pm,
"subscribe":
>we can sea every thing has to be updated  as requried as we felling
select a time preference it works as well
>finlayy select check box value true in object
>and uncheck it changes to false so we able to retrive different form control values
>by making use ngForm and ngModel directive
>input values corresponding test to the field
>in addition of ngModel angular also provides ngModelGroup directive we have to use 
ngModelGroup directive we have to create group and sub group inside form
>lets consider address addrss have street  state city postalcode we group all of those field
with address oblect using ngModelGroup directive lets sea how looks like
>iam going to copy paste html and sea how looks like
>so right of very top iam going to paste html
>so we can sea we have four input element
>one for city one for state one for state finally for postal code
>all four element enclosed within div tag
>so far we have to create basic html form
>that has ngModelGroup directive
>to the directive we assign name called address
>now we goback to browser and take look the form value
>we can sea individual field name name,emails,phone no,topics so on but at start we have group
of poroperties
>and group is address object
>address contain four different property state city country and postal code
>so ifyou ever want to group form field you make use this form tag
>to understand template driven form though we really dont have to focus ngModelGroup directive
>i also keep form as shoot as possible
>thaty iam going to remove code just addeed
>but keep into mind in template driven form for data binding we have to 3 directives
>ngForm,ngModel,ngModelGroup
>all right we able to bind data ngModel directive
>we send to server while requried userForm.value
>although is bind properly to bind use userModel and bind and sent to server

=================
>in this vide to bind form data to model
>as user enters form data will capture changes and update instance of model that can be later
change to the server
>first step generate model class

}
>this is make sure new user automatiically insure all file 
>to find userModel now possible to bind userModel data to enrollemnt form
>simple use cases for this updating and editing data
>that is already saved
>for example you are have e commerece side you have  shipping address
>if you click edit button the form appears with prefilled shipping address data.
>so shipping address is bound to the form
>now youcan sea eventhough anguar create its own objects of form values there are defenatly 
use ccases there is necessary to create own model and bind that models data to the form
>lets to exactly sam in our application
>lets bind user model and enrollement form here lets sea how bind form data and erollment form
>iam using interpolation to bind user data to html form to display sthe view.
>this is helps to sea how the data binding is works
>in html iam going to add horizontal line for seperation
>then user model form json format
>now binding user model to form is really simple
>we bind the porperty of models with ngModel directive
>for property binding we make use square bracesses
>so lets bind all the properties
>so ngModel will replace with [ngModel]="userModel.name" 
>ng model replace with binding of userModel.name 
>remember square brasses for property binding
>user mele property called name we bind that ngModel of name input element
>similarly for email [ngModel]="userModel.email";
>for phone [ngModel]="userModel.phone"
>for topic [ngModel]="userModel.topic"
>iam going to change selected value is empty means
><option value="">iam intrestedd in </option>
>for radio button we required [ngModel]="userModel.timePreference"
>for finally for check box [ngModel]="userModel.subscribe"
>you can sea the browser you can sea angualr form value as same as uservalue
>all the form control are also pre filled with the data of user module
>let me change the name form rob to tim
>if you change that you can sea angular object change from rob to tim but model value not changed
>the reason whcich is we suing property data binding is one way data binding
>data flows from class to view but data doesnt flow from view to class
>what we really want with working with forms is two way binding two way binding can achieve with
banana in box syntax of ngModel directive so each form control we need to change square brasses 
property binding  to bananainside box two way binding
>so parantahasis inside square brasses all right i will replace all occurance of property binding
to two way binding now if we save this and go back to browser change the name form rob to tim.
>you can sea both angular object and model reflect the values
>and is same other type of control as well
>in two way binding we have model and view in sink
>so we have captured all form data into a model
>which can now be sent to server
>how ever before sending it to server it is crucial to perform the client side validation and provide
usefull visual feedback to the user in next video we will sea how angular validate form with ease.
after two way binding the output will be

>form validation providing appropriate visula feedback for validation
>lets sea the video we have to sea the validation for template driven forms
>lets begin understanding how angular helps us how form validation by tracking state of 
form control and applying appropriate class
>i got snapshot form anguar docs which points clearly  what class apply to form control
>based on its state and its validiyt
>at any point of time angular applies three form of control based on its state
>first state for form classes are user is visited the form control or not
>when you load form first time you yet not visited the form field
>at that time angular applied form class is ng-untouched
>if you do visit form control aither clicking or tabing and navigating away from control
angular apply class fo ng-touched
>key point here cclass will change only blur
>you have to navigate away from form control
>so if you visited form control class ng-touched class applied if not visited ng-untouched class
apply
>on similar type angular also track value of form control has been change or not
>againg when we load form very first time  the value yet not change
>so angular applies class ng-prestine  if do change angualr apply class is ng-dirty
>and final pare of classes is consern the validity of form control
>if form control value is valid then ng-valid class applied if not ng-invalid applied
>for example if input field contain required atttibute it implies the value has to be
entered
>if value is missing ng-invalid class is applied
>if value to be enterd ng-valid class going to be applied
>lets going to look visual studio code over here the name input element iam going to add a 
template reference variable #name instd of binding form data lets remove that iam going to bind
inputs class name property
>{{name.className}} here name is reference varibale and className save this and look in browser
>you can sea right away classes being applied on input element are displayed
form-control ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid
>we have form-control is bootstrap class that we have applied
>igonring that we have applied three other class applied on input element
>ng-untouched, ng-pristine, and ng-valid
>all three form angular
>ng-untouched is based on weather form field is visited or not
>no page load on field value not visited
>and hence angular applied class ng-untouched
>now we click on input element you can sea class vlaue doesnt change even class value even
though we visited
>how ever on blur calss does changed from ng-untouched to ng-touched
>when we tab out t changes form ng-untouched to ng-touched
>similary we have ng-pristine and ng-dirty
>based on value of form field is changed or not
>on page load value hasnt changed angular applied ng-prestine
>if we change value to another value you can sea value will cange ng-prestine to ng-drty
>and finally angualr applied ng-valid and ng-invalid classes based on form field validity
>now to test this we have some short of rule in input element
>so iam going to add required attribute
>if you go back browser yoiu can sea class ng-valid applid now whch makes perfect chage there
is value applid in name field
>if however clear out the value you can sea that ng-valid change to ng-invalid
>so we can sea angualr trys to helps out form validation by applying appropriate class to the
form control
>now all the class appropriate to provide visula feedback angualr will provide alternative
which i fill is better as well
>for each of classes angular provide associative property on ngModel directive the property
same of the class ng-remove 
ngModel Properties
===================
class                property
======               ==========
ng-untouched         untouched
ng-touched           touched
ng-prestine          prestine
ng-drty              dirty
ng-valid             valid
ng-invalid           invalid
>ng-untouched is associative property of ngModel which is untouched
>ng-touched is touched and ng-prestine and pristine similarly other classes
>lets quick look this property in enrolment form
>question how we get access of ngModel property
>is answer by simply creating reference to the ngModel directive
>right now #name is points input element of dom
>by assigning value of ngModel the reference variable will point ngModel of particular 
form control
now we have reference to ngModel we can easily bind to different properties
>lets start with unTouched 
>{{name.unTouched}} save this and had to browser we can sea peroperties is true
>below of name field
>if we click and blur it will change into false
>similrly lets take look on prestine
>{{name.prestine}} go back to browser on page load is ture and altering the value it set false
>finally we have valid property  {{name.valid}} input field have value
>in at load value is ther in name field is propoerty torue , while change it changes to false
>so you can sea property returns boolean value is much more easier
>work with then class name
>but i wanted to make sure you understand
>diffferent way angular helps to track state and validity of form control;
>next video we have to sea how ngModel property will utilize to provide visula feed back
>to the user as there felling out form

video no 8
===================
>a good user experience to filling out form a visulally indicate to the user if form field 
is invalid as soon as enter the details
>in this video lets validating the some of the form fields  
>and applying the appropriate class to visually indicate to the user when form is invalid
>there is two approches aither you create own class with necessary styles that has to be
apply to form control or you can apply validation classes the css framework provide
>iam using [class-invalid] bootstrap four provided but we have to make sure we have to apply
class conditionally
>that is only when form control is invalid,lets begin with name of form-control
>the class bootstrap-four provide invalid state is [is-invalid] when i apply this we can sea
red border on form field
>this is sufficent visual feedback for demo
>but must sure class is apply only form control is invalid
>for that we make use ngModel property coupled with class binding,class binding begin with 
square brasses class followed by dot  class name is conditionally applied
>[class.is-invalid] this will be applied only the form control is invalid
>we use reference value of ngModel that is name check by invalid property
>[class.is-invalid]="name.invalid" this name is reach out apply class invalid while name
of the form control is invalid
>remove where written class="form-control is-invalid" to change into class="form-control"
>we take look of browser we can sea no red red border on name
>if i clear out the name the border gets applied
>so visual feedback is working as expected
>how ever there is room for improvement
>lets say we have a form not pre filled with data
>name is not filled while bigin is empty we goto visula studio code we remove name.valid
>go to app.component.ts and leave name is empty in user model
>now go back to browser you can sea red border
>there is no mistake form field is impact invalid but imagine ten such form field  load on 
page load without any user interaction
>kinds of loops back somethihng we going to avoid
>so in addition to checking form control is invalid so we have to check aither user is 
visited that form control
>back in the html inthe class binding we also check form control has been touched
>we have to write [class.is-invalid]="name.invalid && name.touched" 
>let me break it down to couple of line
>appy [class.is-invalid] if form control is touched and form control is invalid
finallly the complete field will looks like
<div class="form-group">
<label>name</label>
<input type="text" requried #name="ngModel" [class.is-invalid]="name.invalid && name.touched"
class="form-control" name="userName" [(ngModel)]="userModel.name">
</div>
>while you look in browser while page load the form field doesnt have red border
>we click inside and navigate away though a red border is applied
>this is preety good for ux point of view
>on similar line lets have pattern matching validation
>you can baiscally add any regular expression you want to  create a pattern that your form
field must be satisfied
>for example a password must be 8 to 15 charecter atlist one special charecter
>a pincode in a specific format
>a phone number is in ca spiecific format
>the possibility are inless
>for our example letes keep simple a phone number must be in 10 digits
>go back to visual studio code get a referece for ngModel directive
>#phone="ngModel" secod step add pattern attribute for regular expression
>pattern="^\d{10}$" this is not phone number validation we just sure validate the 
and makesure is 10 digits
>finally lets bind the invalid class
>[class.is-invalid]="phone.invalid && phone.touched"  class followed by dot and is invalid
is conditionally applid what si condition phone form control is invalid and it has to be 
touched
>save the file and lets look at browser
>we going to remove a couple of number form form field and tab out you can sea the red border
is applied
>if we enter 10 digits the red border dis appear
>so pattern validatio wroking as exprected
>this is preety much idea about filed validation and template driven form
>using ngModel propoety and class binding conditionally apply class is visually indicate
the invalid state so right now we have provided visual feed back to the user if something
wrong in form field
>how ever that is not enough
>it should dilplay appropriate error message
>lets look of that in next video

video no 9
===============================
>this video we are going to display appropriate error messages
>when form field is invalid
>trust me with understand of previous video this is going to be pretty starte forwrod
>name field in our example is required field
>so form filld is invalid we need to show error message filed is required
>lets add the messaage in html in vs code app.component.html
>right after the input element i will add a <small>name is required</small>
>name is required
>if i save this we can sea error in the browser
>name is required we can sea in browser
>ofcourse we want to be shown this field only the filld is invalid
>lets add condition with ngModel property
> we can use either ng-if or class binding better to show display propoerty
>ofcourse i will  show how to use both of them
>for class binding i have to use class d-none is bootstrp four class to setting up
display propoerty to be none condition is inverse in use last video
>within small tag class binding within square brasses class forllowed by dot class which
we want to apply that is d-none that condition should be name.valid and name.touched

<small class="text-danger" [class.d-none]="name.valid||name.untouched">name is required</small>
</div>

>dont show the error message if fom control is valid and untouched
>if you take look in browser initially is hidden if we clear out text and we navigate 
away message will appears
>so we are displaying error message appropiratly
>last thing we add a class thats makes message appears like an error message
>for that purpose we need to use text dander
>again we use bootstrap 4 class="text danger"
>if you take look in browser clear out form fild and take away
>the message really look like error message
>name is required
>really we get this lets sure same for phone field
>go back to vs code for the phone number field   
>finally the name field will be show like that

>now we might run into senarios
>where we have more then one validation happning one form field
>example phone number control will have requried validation addition to the pattern validation
>to keep it simple phone number will be required and must be ten digits
>this message can be saits fy both the messages
>lets quickly test it out go back to vs code 
>app  ly message phone number is requried and must be 10 digits
>go back to browser and sea intitally there is no error message
>remove the couple of digits  and tab out and you can sea error messages
>phone number must be requried and ten digits
>remove it completlyy you can get error message, when i start to feeling it error message
will stay till ten digits
>preety easy to deal multiple validation
>how ever you goto extra mile with user expreience spot on error mesages
>before that go on error property the ngModel
>first i will comment out the existing error messages
>next add div tag conditionallay renderd where phone number is error or not
>befor  that we have to use ngIf directive along with ngModel propeerty
>in div tag you write ngIf=phone.errors and phone.invaid or phone.touched
>so phone field has error and phone state has invalid and phone state has visited
>only then render this div tag
>first message phone number is required and secod message  phone number must be ten digits
>way we can decide what will be shown using error porperty of ngModel
>for first case ngIf=phone.errors.requried so if rquired validation happning only display
this validation messages
>next message for phone.error.pattern the pattern validaion is applied dilplay this error
messages
> now you take look in browser i remove two to three digits it will show only pattern
validation
>when i clear out text required validation will be apperar
>usign error object you can display specific error messages
>that preety much about displaying error messages in template driven forms
>for single validation rule create containts that display error messages
>div class="form-group">
<label>phone</label>
