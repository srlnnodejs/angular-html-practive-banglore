reactive forms
=================
>in this vide lets closer looks reactive forms in angualr
>in reactive forms much of logics are residing in component class
>this is different form template deriven forms which is more focus in html templates
>there is also no two way binding in reactive forms
>instad the name suggest we need to react user input to update  values 
>angualr also provide methods  also update form control  value component class
>we will understand better  we start coding
> reactive forms are suited for complex senario
>now what are such senario
>you might want form field to be dynamics
for example
============
>i will begin form for single field allow user to give phone number also give option
and give additional field to enter alternate phone number
>that is dynamic phone element
>you might also enter custom validation for certain filed
>for password and confirm password
>we might also want validation dynamic
>for instance if we want to subscribe field i want email field to be mandatory
>if user doesnt want to subscribe  email field is opeitonal so dynamic validaiton
>like this case type complex scenarios reactive form must be compulsory
>reactive forms also makes possible for unit tests logic in your type script file code
and class
>now all advantages come across
>reactive forms approch requires more coding as beginner is slightly more difficult
to understand compare to template driven forms
>not warry that is exacly reason for our course of reactive forms
>lets sea how we go to proceed rest of the course
>we will startup brand new project generated by cli
>we will add html the form we working on that >
>ones html complete we will add model of the form for form group and form control
classes
>we will also sea to manage form control values
>that is followed by formbuilder service is simpler way to specify form models
>ones we data exchange happning between template and class 
>we will move on validations
>validaiton will be simple custom cross-field and dynamic validaiton
>we will also sea how to add dynamic form controls
>finally we go reactive form on submitting form controls

=============
>in this video add html our component template
>keep it simple user creating registrration form
>to get started i have generated angualr project running commands 
ng new reactive-forms
>jsust like template driven forms i have also added bootstrap four class
>lets open app.component.html
>lest begin by removing existing markup
>went app.component.html
>work stated and iam telling you simulteneously what is the work flow
>hadding i will add registration form
>below hadding we start registration from within form tag
>first we add user name 
>first we add form-group inside div tag
>add label username
>and input type text i enter form-control
>here form-group and form-control are bootstrap class
>next form control is for entring the password
>so we have label password and input element type password
>again bootstrap class for form-group and form-control
>similary we have another one for user to confirm password
>so label is confirm-passwrod and input type is password
>finally button for user to submit the form
>button class is btn btn-primary and type is submit 
> and text is register
>save this and take look form in browser
>lets go for terminal and run ng serve
>we will get form for username,password, and confirm password
>we also have submit button for submit registion form
>please note that in html there is no difference between template
driven forms and reactive forms
>the html always component template
>now html template ready and accept inputs to create model for registraion
form it makes data exchange possible between template and class
>form will be
app.component.html
