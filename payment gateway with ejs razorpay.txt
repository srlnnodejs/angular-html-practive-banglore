razorpay payment gateway with ejs    29-1-2021
======================================
>wee all doing with nodejs and template making with ejs
>we dont need to any exprerience in ejs because we only going to do 
only one aspect that using the variable we going to sending from backend
to frontend
>for that purpose only we going to use ejs
>other wise we would have done in html
>first of all lets make an entry point app.js

app.js
======
>open the terminal taking little bit of time
>on terminal add npm init actually we dont have to put anything to init
>just change the name into razorpay
>if you name as razorpay while installing package you will be introuble
>name any other thing like payment
>we done npm init and we got package.json file
>in this package.json file we need to store all dev dependency 
>scripts and meta data all 
>now will be installing require npm packages
>most important is express and dotenv becaure we writing key id and 
key secret in dotenv file
>because we dont want to any other person look into the code find out the
key id and key secret
>those are thing that wee need to write in file doesnt need to be display
>code like if you use mongodb you know secret urls
>that contain password as well db
>so these are thing we need to display the code 
>all those stufs we need to store in dotenv file
>and those env variable can use code itself
>so express dotenv and cors bodyparser and razorpay and crypto for encoding
the data
> that will be sening in payment toatlly six packages installing it gona
take some time
>now iam installed express dotenv cors and body-parser razorpay and crypto
for encoding the data that will be sening in payment row
>go to terminal 
install
>npm i express body-parser razorpay cors crypto
install all thing in command line
>in mean while go to razorpay payment page
>gather the key id and key secret
>now go razorpay side
razorpay.com
=============
>do login but you do signup first  after signup you will get email and 
password
>after login you will get razorpay dahsboard 
>for getting key id and key secret first time you need to  click setting
>and click on apikeys
>because ihave already generated key once there ie option to generate test
key
>here is the test key because currently running in the test mode
>to activate in live mode i need to activate live account
>so this is for demo purpose only iam running in test mode
>because iam already generted test key before iam getting option of 
regenerating
>click that and click on De activat Old Key Immedetly
>and here i will get all details i need
> as a keyid and keysecret
>so i will be creating .env file right now
>pelase enter details in .env file
>.env
==========
inside .env file lets enter the key id first
>.env
=======
KEY_ID="asldjfak;lfjd;kslafjd;lskf"
KEY_SC=";J;KLSAJDFKASJDK;LSAJDKHASPOFUEIOWRQUPEOR"

this done lets move to app.js file
>do the basic stufs that is requireing package
>lets start work in app.js file
>first import express package
>do dotenv configuraiton required because we suing dotenv file 
>in order to install we need to import npm package and requrie into app.js
file
>then go to cross origin resource sharing 
>you can skip the part now import bodyparser 
>now import crypto next thing iam going to explaining payment flow
>so that we can make smooth tranzition between front end and backend
>to avoid confusion 
>crypto all the packages been required
>let to to image part download the payment flow image
>so before image go to app.js file and write your scripts
app.js
========
let express=require("express");
const dotenv=require("dotenv");
const cors=require("cors");
const bodyParser=require("body-parser");
const crypto=require("crypto");

>now move to image part so here we have image of the payment flow
> as a client you will get the front end template at your schreen
>details we will pass through razorpay payment gateway through api
>amount and there is the details like name or some thing
>but amount is most important thing 
>to create instantiate the order
>and while doing with inr the default package payment mode for razor pay
is paisa not  rupes
>waht is rupes you want you have to multiply in to 100  and pass the amount
>so for ten rupes you need to put 1000 
>first step customer proceed to pay first here 
>backend api it fires oerder api 
>creating in order 
>order is created by razor pay it returns order id
>what we do we need to capture order id and store in input field
>and then we going to make checkout from out of this
>we will put details like this order id and amount
>the razorpay key and all this we creating checkout form submitting 
the checkout form back to the razor pay
>this will be also done by api it self that done the process done payment
is verified
>razor pay retruns set of credentials
>razorpa_payment_id,razorpay_order_id,razorpay_signature
>at the end we will comparing razor pay signature and expected signarture
>if both signature same we will tell payment is cpatured and we did
sucessfull payment tranjaction
>so this is the basic payment flow that we are following
>instead of backend lets start doing front end part first
>that willl bee you can easyle understand
>so we creting views folder here inside view folder we need to creating
payment.ejs
===========
10.07
=====
>will be createing views folder here inside view folder we creating 
payment.ejs
>ejs just only html but you can also add java script on it
>for more lenthtee i have written code here and i will be explain code
to you
>first thing you will put label for amount 
<label for="">Amount:</label>
>what ever peace you want you multiply by hundered and put here
>and right here input field weill bhe give id will be order-amt that in later
we can refer and fetch order amount from write here
<input type="text" id="order-amt">
>given to little space and this is the button will be embadding event
listner to it that will create order and recieve order id from razorpay
server
>we given special id 
<button id="order-button1">create order</button>
<br/>
>and we written script here that added event listner when we click on the
button the function will be fire
>which will be having event in the parameter
document.getElementById("order-button1").onclick=function(e){}
>it will be creating post request to this url
var url="/api/payment/order"
>which will be instantieate order and create order and collect order id
from server
>and what details we sending amount,currency,reciept, payment_capture
>that actually payment capture method will be either 0 or1
>1 for the automatic payment capture and 0 for manual
>by default we using automatic payment capture 1
>the currency is inr
>reciept is any thing unique string you can put here
>reciept you have to put wthcoding001
>its upto you what ever you want
var param={
amount:document.getElementById("order-amt").value,
currency:"INR",
receipt:"whcoding001",
payment_capture:"1"};
>that done we collected we collect amount from input field 
that is 
amount:document.getElementById("order-amt").value
>we have given id order-amt and now we going to create new xml http request
>now what it will do it will recieve the response from backend and update
>the dom without actually rerendring the page
>that done when ever we will be getting response
>when ever we will recieve order id from ther server that will be a 
state change this  xmlHttp request will listen for it whenever there will
be state change it will fireup a function 
>when readyState===4 actually means that we got resposne successfully
>executin this below if block
now the thing will be pass then we will store in it 
document.getElementByiD("rzp-text").value=res.sub.id

var xmlHttp=new XMLhttpRequest();
xmlHttp.onreadystatechange=function(res){
if(xmlHttp.readyState===4){
res=JSON.parse(xmlHttp.resposneText);
document.getElementById("rzp-text").value=res.sub.id
}}
>so we havent created the input field for actually storing value here created 
and write here earlier input field itself
>will be creating it later here id is rzp-text  will be pupulating input
field with order id automatically 
>document.getElementById("rzp-text").value=res.sub.id
>if you got confuse what is the above line it is input field wrote here
below html order id to automate things 
<input type="text" name="" id="rzp-text">
>so last thing we done specify this is post request we have writter above
xmlHttp.open("Post",url,true),
inside above request true means request we sendign asynchronous
>so will be waiting for the actual response
>not automatically render the data
>that done we have to set request header 
>xmlHttp.setRequestHeader and we have to send data in the form of string
>



var xmlHttp=new XMLhttpRequest();
xmlHttp.onreadystatechange=function(res){
if(xmlHttp.readyState===4){
res=JSON.parse(xmlHttp.resposneText);
document.getElementById("rzp-text").value=res.sub.id
}}
